&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If more categories arise and I see it right to delineate them I will. Otherwise, these are designed to be MOSTLY copy/paste-able without much modification to work. My preferences are strange and sometimes esoteric with formatting, but my avoidance of namespaces (with some exceptions) means not much is intertwined in such a way as to make it impossible to dissect and integrate elsewhere.
